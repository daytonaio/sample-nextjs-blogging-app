## üöÄ Getting Started  

### Open Using Daytona  

1. **Install Daytona**: Follow the [Daytona installation guide](https://www.daytona.io/docs/installation/installation/).  
2. **Create the Workspace**:  
   ```bash  
   daytona create https://github.com/daytonaio/sample-nextjs-blogging-app
   ```  
3. **Create an .env folder in your root level of application by following env.sample**

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=<postgresdburl>
   SECRET_KEY=<secretkey>
   MINDSDB_KEY=<mindsdbapikey>
   BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   MINDS_URL=http://localhost:47334
   ```
   To know how to get the mindsdb_key, refer to this blog: [https://dev.to/niharikaa/mindsdb-integrate-aiml-models-into- 
   your-applications-4oc7](https://dev.to/niharikaa/mindsdb-integrate-aiml-models-into- 
   your-applications-4oc7)
   To get the database_url quickly, go to Aiven and get a PostgreSQL DB instance. [aiven.io](https://aiven.io/)


4. **Start the Application**:  
   ```bash  
      npm run dev
   ```  


5. **You can see that on port 47334 minds db editor is running,just run these models by going /editor route**
   ```sql
   CREATE ML_ENGINE minds_endpoint_engine

   prompt_template = 'You are an AI-powered data retrieval assistant. I will provide you with a query about a specific topic. Your task is to retrieve relevant information 
   and provide a detailed, accurate, and informative response. The response should be structured as follows:

    - **Topic Overview**: A brief overview of the topic.
    - **Details**: Detailed information related to the query.
    - **Sources**: Any sources or references where the information can be verified.

    Ensure that the response is informative and comprehensive, formatted using Markdown.

    Here is the query:

    genes.';
   
   ```
 ## Explanation of the Code

### **1. ML Engine Creation**

- Initializes an ML engine (`minds_endpoint_engine`) using the MindsDB API.
- The engine connects via an API key for secure communication.

### **2. `blog_helper` Model**

- A **chat assistant model** designed to generate detailed and structured responses.
- Key attributes:
  - Uses the `mistral-7b` AI model.
  - Processes user queries with a specific **prompt template**.
  - Outputs responses formatted in Markdown, including:
    - **Topic Overview**
    - **Detailed Information**
    - **Sources**

### **3. `topic_classifier_model`**

- A **classification model** for assigning input text to one of 60+ predefined categories.
- Categories include fields like:
  - Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Biology, Cybersecurity, Music, Psychology, etc.
- Operates using a prompt to analyze and classify input text.

### **4. Querying Models**

- **`blog_helper`**:  
  Processes queries like ‚ÄúWhat is a Chip?‚Äù and returns:
  - A **topic overview**, **detailed explanation**, and **sources** in Markdown format.

- **`topic_classifier_model`**:  
  Classifies text, such as reviews or scientific descriptions, into relevant topics like ‚ÄúBiology‚Äù or ‚ÄúMachine Learning.‚Äù

6. **Now you are good to goüöÄ**
